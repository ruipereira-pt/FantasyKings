/*
  # Add Unique Constraint on Player Name
  
  This migration adds a unique constraint on the players.name column to enable
  upsert operations using the name field for conflict resolution.
  
  This is needed for the Sportradar integration to work properly when upserting
  player data using the onConflict: "name" clause.
